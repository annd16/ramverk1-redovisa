[FIGURE src=image/php-med-trans.png?w=95 caption="Anax - a PHP framework."]


The course <strong>ramverk1</strong> (or <strong>framework1</strong> in english) is, as the name in implies, a study in frameworks, and to be more specific php frameworks.

Anax is a php framework developed by the head teacher of this course to be used as a tool to learn to get acquainted with the most important parts that constitutes a typical framework and the services usually offered by such a framework, learn how to use such a framework, (- and if necessary in the future perhaps even build our own framework!).
